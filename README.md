# about-me
-website showcasing my many virtues ;)

-website displays a placeholder Avatar picture along with name and basic introductory information (to be added to later)

-internal links in the fixed header all function to lead to specified section, except for Resume, as I dont have a proper resume yet. 

-website contains section for 5 projects to be previewed (only one project is currently preiviewed, but empty blocks are 
used as placeholders to ensure structure and adaptability function as required.

-first project is in a seperate section and larger than the others. 

-first project has a functioning link to the live site.

-Contact section has several functioning links to websites. 

-website adapts to different screen sizes using Flex mechanics. 

-More functioning links to be added later, when professional accounts are made/updated. 
in order for a proper check for functionality, the instagram and email links lead to a personal accounts.
consider the rest place holders.

-external sources used are many stack-overflow articles while troubleshooting, Google fonts for fonts, and Font Awesome for icons. 

-Meyer web was used for resset.css and https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/#half-rombes was used as the base for the linear gradient that is currently commented out for future use. 

-I honestly dont remeber where I got the img used in title section, its been sitting as my desktop background for like three and half years. 
Like 98% sure it was a free source img but was honestly struggling to find it again online.
